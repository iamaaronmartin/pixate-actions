Actions for creating elements in Pixate prototypes

# Drag view
This will create a view that lives off the screen, that once called, will slide in from the right as a "card" element. Built in to the drag interaction is a conditional that will snap the view back in place if released on the left half of the screen, and will slide away and hide itself if released on the right half of the screen.
